LaVey presumably started the First Church of Satan in 1966. As a self-proclaimed authority on everything evil, he began giving weekly lectures at a cost of $2.00 per person. And thus the Church of Satan was born.\nThe First Satanic Church is an organization founded by Karla LaVey on October 31, 1997 in San Francisco, California, that is dedicated to LaVeyan Satanism as codified by Anton LaVey in The Satanic Bible. The church's stated mission is to carry on the legacy of Anton LaVey through \"the study of Satanism and the occult sciences\". The church operates The 600 Club, an Internet forum dedicated to discussions of Satanism.\nThe Temple of Set is an occult initiatory order founded in 1975. A new religious movement and form of Western esotericism, the Temple espouses a religion known as Setianism, whose practitioners are called Setians. This is sometimes identified as a form of Satanism, although this term is not often embraced by Setians and is contested by some academics.\nLuciferianism can be understood best as a belief system or intellectual creed that venerates the essential and inherent characteristics that are affixed and commonly given to Lucifer.\n the Order of Nine Angles was established in Shropshire, Western England during the late 1960s, when a Grand Mistress united a number of ancient pagan groups active in the area.\n The Satanic Temple(since 2013) has become the primary religious Satanic organization in the world, with chapters internationally, and a number of high-profile public campaigns designed to preserve and advance secularism and individual liberties. The rise of The Satanic Temple has been met with an increase in commentary regarding what Satanism is as media outlets struggle to grasp how this upstart religion has begun to shift religious liberty debates with mere claims of equal access.",

The historical view that Africans had to become \"civilized\" by slavery, colonialism and Christian missionary activity likely contributed to the intolerance of traditional religions during the colonial period. These views culminated in some colonials rejecting that traditional African faiths were proper religions.\nPersecution of Christians: Christianity is experiencing its greatest growth in Africa, Christians are increasingly seen as a threat to Muslim-dominated lands and governments. Mass territories of uninhabited, ungoverned regions provide easy cover for Islamic terror group activities. Eritrean President Isaias Afewerki was said to \u201Cfear Christian evangelism because it could destabilize and disunite the country.\u201D creating tensions between Christian and others.\nFolk religion is employed also by combining some of its practices with those of mega religions.

Without question, folk religion is considered a distorted, if not meaningless, practice of religion by lay people outside of the control of clergy or the supervision of theologians.

Swedenborg had a prolific career as an inventor and scientist. At 56, he claimed to have experienced visions of the spiritual world and talked with angels, devils, and spirits by visiting heaven and hell. He claimed he was directed by the Lord Jesus Christ to reveal the doctrines of his second coming.\nSisters Leah (1814\u201390), Margaretta (1836\u201393), and Catherine (1838\u201392) Fox played an important role in the development of Modern Spiritualism. The daughters of John and Margaret Fox, they were residents of Hydesville, New York. In 1848, the family began to hear unexplained rapping sounds. Kate and Maggie conducted channeling sessions in an attempt to contact the presumed spiritual entity creating the sounds, and claimed contact with the spirit of a peddler who was allegedly murdered and buried beneath the house. A skeleton later found in the basement seemed to confirm this. The Fox girls became instant celebrities. They demonstrated their communication with the spirit by using taps and knocks, automatic writing or psychography, and later even voice communication, as the spirit took control of one of the girls.\nAfter the news of the Fox sisters came to France, people became more interested in what was sometimes termed the \"Spiritual Telegraph\". Planchette, the precursor of the pencil-less Ouija boards, simplified the writing process which achieved widespread popularity in America and Europe.\nFranz Anton Mesmer (May 23, 1734 \u2013 March 5, 1815) discovered what he called magn\u00E9tisme animal (animal magnetism), which became known as mesmerism. The evolution of Mesmer's ideas and practices led Scottish surgeon James Braid (1795\u20131860) to develop hypnotism in 1841.\n\nSpiritism incorporated various concepts from Mesmerism,[citation needed] among them faith healing and the energization of water to be used as a medicine.",

S\u00E9ances and necromancy are occult activities forbidden by God (Leviticus 19:31; 20:6; Galatians 5:20; 2 Chronicles 33:6). The fact that Spiritism places the occult under a veil of \u201Cscience\u201D makes no difference. The Bible tells us that the spirit world is off-limits to us, for our own protection. The spirits with which Spiritism has to do are not human; the Bible says that the spirits of men face judgment after death (Hebrews 9:27), and there is nothing in Scripture to suggest that spirits return to the land of the living for any reason or in any form. We know that Satan is a deceiver (John 8:44). The rational conclusion, from Scripture, is that any contact spiritists have with the \u201Csouls of the departed\u201D is actually contact with demons in disguise (Revelation 12:9). Spiritism is not compatible with the Bible and is spiritually dangerous. \u201CBe alert and of sober mind.

The Torah says God wants the people of Israel to walk in His ways, to love Him, and to serve Him, and to keep God\u2019s commandments (Deut. 10:12\u201313). Actions are more important than beliefs and beliefs must be made into actions.\n4.The Land of Israel is holy in Judaism. A Jewish belief is that God created the Earth from Mount Moriah in Jerusalem in the Land of Israel, and He is always closest to this land. Jews believe that this land is where God told the Jewish people to build a society to serve Him, and many mitzvot (commandments) in the Torah are about the Land of Israel.\n5.The story of leaving Egypt, called the Exodus, is very important in the way the Jewish people understand the world. The Torah tells how God took a group of slaves, the Israelites, from slavery, and tells them how to be His partner to build the world. Jews see this story as a model for the whole world. In the future, the whole world will change, and all the people of the world will serve the one God. This will be God\u2019s kingdom on Earth. They believe the whole of Jewish history, and world history, is part of this process.\n6. Rabbinic Jews also believe that there is another part of the Torah besides the five books of Moses. It is called the Mishnah, also called the Oral Torah or Oral Law. It explains how to follow the laws written in the 5 books. There is a commentary (explanation) of the Mishnah, called the Gemara. Together, the Mishna and the Gemara make up the Talmud. But Karaite Jews believe that there is no additional Torah besides the five books of Moses.",

It arose as a spiritual revival movement in the territory of contemporary Western Ukraine during the 18th century, and spread rapidly throughout Eastern Europe.\n5.Karaite Judaism or Karaism is a Jewish religious movement characterized by the recognition of the written Torah alone as its supreme authority in halakha and theology.\nJewish Renewal is a recent movement in Judaism which endeavors to reinvigorate modern Judaism with Kabbalistic, Hasidic, and musical practices. Specifically, it seeks to reintroduce the \"ancient Judaic traditions of mysticism and meditation, gender equality and ecstatic prayer\" to synagogue services.\n6.Humanistic Judaism is a Jewish movement that offers a nontheistic alternative in contemporary Jewish life. It defines Judaism as the cultural and historical experience of the Jewish people.\n7.Messianic Judaism is a modern syncretic religious movement that combines Christianity\u2014most importantly, the belief that Jesus is the Jewish messiah\u2014with elements of Judaism and Jewish tradition.

Security incidents and attacks on Jews and Jewish installations were reported around the globe: in France and Belgium, Denmark and Germany, Ukraine and Russia, Poland and Hungary, but also places such as Australia, India or Uruguay.\nThe story of the Jews in Arab lands still forms a major gap in most of the world's knowledge of the history of the Middle East. Jewish presence in what are now Arab lands long predates Islam and the Arab conquest of the Middle East and goes back to Biblical times. In 1945, there were approximately 866,000 Jews living in communities throughout the Arab world. Today, there are fewer than 7,000. In many Arab states, once thriving Jewish communities have all but disappeared. According to official statistics, 856,000 Jews , persecuted and under duress, were exiled from their homes in Arab countries between 1948 and the early 1970s leaving behind substantial property and other assets.",

God and His Creation - The Bah\u00E1\u2019\u00ED Writings explain that the reality of God is beyond the understanding of any mortal mind, though we may find expressions of His attributes in every created thing. \n4. Essential Relationships - Realization of the principle of the oneness of humanity is at once the goal and operating principle of Bah\u00E1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00E1h\u2019s revelation.\n5. Universal Peace - The teachings of Baha\u2019u\u2019llah are vast in their scope, exploring as they do such themes as the nature and purpose of Revelation, the inherent nobility of the human being, the cultivation of spiritual qualities, and humanity\u2019s interactions with the natural world.\nThe following are a few examples from Bah\u00E1\u02BCu'll\u00E1h's teachings on personal conduct that are required or encouraged of his followers:\n\nExhortations:\n1.Bah\u00E1\u02BC\u00EDs over the age of 15 should individually recite an obligatory prayer each day, using fixed words and form.\n2.In addition to the daily obligatory prayer, Bah\u00E1\u02BC\u00EDs should offer daily devotional prayer and to meditate and study sacred scripture.\n3.Adult Bah\u00E1\u02BC\u00EDs should observe a Nineteen-Day Fast each year during daylight hours in March, with certain exemptions.\n4.There are specific requirements for Bah\u00E1\u02BC\u00ED burial that include a specified prayer to be read at the interment.

Baha\u2019is have the difficulty of explaining how they can have an elaborate theology about God yet assert that God is \"unknowable.\" And it does not help to say that prophets and manifestations inform mankind about God because, if God is \"unknowable,\" then humanity has no reference point whereby to tell which teacher is telling the truth. Christianity rightly teaches that God can be known, as is naturally known even by non-believers, though they may not have a relational knowledge of God.

Some artifacts found in the Indus Valley civilization have been suggested as a link to ancient Jain culture, but this is highly speculative and a subjective interpretation. This theory has not been accepted by most scholars because very little is known about the Indus Valley iconography and script. The last two tirthankara, the 23rd tirthankara Parshvanatha (c. 8th\u20137th century BCE)[5][6][7] and the 24th tirthankara Mahavira (c.\u2009599 \u2013 c.\u2009527 BCE) are considered historical figures. Mahavira was the elder contemporary of the Buddha. According to Jain texts, the 22nd Tirthankara Neminath lived about 85,000 years ago and was the cousin of Hindu god Krishna.

The other mahavratas are non-attachment to possessions, not lying, not stealing, and sexual restraint (with celibacy as the ideal).",

Diwali / Deepavali \nDiwali is one of the most important festival in India. Mahavir attained nirvana followed by moksha on this day in 527 BCE. It falls on the last day of Ashvina month of Jain calendar. It is also the last day of Indian calendar. It comes during October or November. It is believed that the eighteen kings of northern India, followers of Mahavira, decided to light lamps (known as dipa) symbolizing knowledge of Mahavira. So it is known as Deepavali or Diwali.\n6.

      "pName": "Shinto, also known as Shintoism or kami-no-michi, is a religion originating from Japan.",
      "pFounder": "According to revived Shinto doctrine, the sovereignty of the emperor was exercised by divine right through his reputed descent from the sun goddess Amaterasu Omikami, who is considered the founder of the Japanese nation. But broadly speaking, Shint\u014D has no founder. When the Japanese people and Japanese culture became aware of themselves, Shint\u014D was already there. ",
      "pDoOrigin": "In the late 6th century AD the name Shinto was created for the native religion to distinguish it from Buddhism and Confucianism, which had been introduced from China. Shinto was rapidly overshadowed by Buddhism, and the native gods were generally regarded as manifestations of Buddha in a previous state of existence.",
      "pPoOrigin": "Japanese cult and religion, originating in prehistoric times, and occupying an important national position for long periods in the history of Japan, particularly in recent times.",
      "pPopulation": "Shinto is primarily found in Japan, where there are around 80,000 public shrines; the country's shrine organization claims 113 million adherents. Shinto is also practiced elsewhere, in smaller numbers.",
      "pDoctrine": "The two fundamental Shinto doctrines are that Japan is the country of the gods and her people are the descendants of gods. This concept of the divine descent of the Japanese people, as well as the divine origin of the land, has given rise to a conviction of superiority over other countries and peoples. With the exception of a few designated sects of Shinto, the religion has no founder, no sacred writings, and no authoritative set of beliefs. Worship takes place at one of the numerous shrines in the country of Japan, although many Japanese have altars in their home to one or more of the large number of deities.\n\nThe word Shinto comes from the Chinese word Shen-tao, which means \u201Cthe way of the gods.\u201D A major feature of Shinto is the notion of kami, the concept of sacred power in both animate and inanimate objects. There is in Shinto a powerful sense of the presence of gods and spirits in nature. The gods of Shinto are too numerous to be grouped into a hierarchy, but the sun goddess Amaterasu is highly revered, and her grand imperial temple is located 200 miles southwest of Tokyo. Shinto teaches that the Japanese people are themselves descended from the kami.\n\nAt the core of Shinto is the belief in and worship of kami\u2014the essence of spirit that can be present in all things.\nAccording to Shinto belief, the natural state of human beings is purity. Impurity comes from everyday occurrences but can be cleansed through ritual.\nVisiting shrines, purification, reciting prayers, and giving offerings are essential Shinto practices.\nFunerals do not take place in Shinto shrines, as death is considered impure. \n\nThe order of rituals at a grand festival is usually as follows:\n1.Purification rites (harae)\u2014commonly held at a corner of the shrine precincts before participants come into the shrine but sometimes held within the shrine before beginning a ceremony.\n2.Adoration\u2014the chief priest and all the congregation bow to the altar.\n3.Opening of the door of the inner sanctuary (by the chief priest).\n4.Presentation of food offerings\u2014rice, sake wine, rice cakes, fish, seaweed, vegetables, salt, water, etc., are offered but animal meat is not, because of the taboo on shedding blood in the sacred area. In the past cooked food was usually offered to kami, but nowadays uncooked food is more often used. In accordance with this change, the idea of entertaining kami changed to that of thanksgiving.\n5.Prayer\u2014the chief priest recites prayers (norito) modeled on ancient Shint\u014D prayers. These prayers were compiled in the early 10th century and were based on the old belief that spoken words had spiritual potency.\n6.Sacred music and dance.\n7.General offering\u2014participants in the festival make symbolic offerings using little branches of the evergreen sacred tree to which strips of white paper are tied.\n8.Taking offerings away.\n9.Shutting the door of the inner sanctuary.\n10.Final adoration.\n11.Feast (naorai).",
      "pDeviation": "Jinja (Shrine) Shinto\nShrine Shinto is closest to the traditional form of Shinto that is said to date back to prehistoric times.\n\nThe term is usually used to refer to the beliefs and rituals associated with the shrines that give their allegiance to the Jinja Honcho or Association of Shinto Shrines.\n\nKy\u00F4ha (Sect) Shinto\nSect Shinto started in the 19th Century and includes 13 major independent sects which are officially recognised by the Japanese governement.\n\nThe 13 sects, with their date of formal recognition, are:\n\nFusoky\u00F4 (1882)\nIzumo Oyashiroky\u00F4 (1882)\nJikkoky\u00F4 (1882)\nKonkoky\u00F4 (1900)\nKurozumiky\u00F4 (1876)\nMisogiky\u00F4 (1894)\nOntakeky\u00F4, formerly known as Mitakeky\u00F4 (1882)\nShinriky\u00F4 (1894)\nShinshuky\u00F4 (1882)\nShinto Shusei-ha (1876)\nShinto Taiky\u00F4, known before World War II simply as Shinto (1886)\nTaiseiky\u00F4 (1882)\nTenriky\u00F4 (1908)\nMinzoku (Folk) Shinto\nThis is the name given to the traditional Shinto that was practiced by ordinary Japanese people at their local shrines, and that was not instutionalised by the various national reforms.\n\nFolk Shinto influences many of the rites of passage celebrated in Japan, together with agricultural and other festivals.",
      "pFestivals": "Each Shint\u014D shrine has several major festivals each year, including the Spring Festival (Haru Matsuri, or Toshigoi-no-Matsuri; Prayer for Good Harvest Festival), Autumn Festival (Aki Matsuri, or Niiname-sai; Harvest Festival), an Annual Festival (Rei-sai), and the Divine Procession (Shink\u014D-sai).

Only faith in the shed blood of Jesus Christ on the cross can accomplish cleansing from sin and make us acceptable to a holy God.\nShintoism fosters pride and feelings of superiority in the Japanese people; such elitism is condemned in Scripture.

Its pantheon of saints includes such diverse figures as the Buddha, Confucius, Jesus Christ, Mu\u1E25ammad, Pericles, Julius Caesar, Joan of Arc, Victor Hugo, and Sun Yat-sen. In Cao Dai, God is represented as an eye in a triangle, a symbol that appears on the facades of the sect\u2019s temples. The religion\u2019s organization is patterned after that of Roman Catholicism, with a pope, cardinals, and archbishops. Worship involves elaborate rituals and festivals.\nThe three teachings represent levels of spiritual attainment. In Cao Dai's teaching being a Buddha is the hardest to achieve. Cao Dai teaches that humans can develop into other beings. Humans can develop into: Th\u1EA7n (angel), Th\u00E1nh (saint), Ti\u00EAn (sage), and Ph\u1EADt (buddha).

      "pDeviation": "\nTay Ninh Caodaism\nThis is the original sect of Caodaism under the full name Tay Ninh Caodaist Holy See (Cao Dai Toa thanh Tay Ninh). Since it is the original branch, the history of Caodaism is closely related to it.\n\nBan Chinh Dao (Religious Reform Board) Caodaism is the second largest sect of Caodaism, only after Tay Ninh Caodaism. It was founded in the mid 1930s. Specifically, in 1934, due to conflicts with some other high-ranking dignitaries of Caodaism, Dau su Nguyen Ngoc Tuong and Dau su Le Ba Trang left Tay Ninh Caodaism.\n\nTien Thien Caodaism\nAfter its official establishment in Tay Ninh in 1926, Caodaism expanded its missionary work in the provinces of the Mekong River Delta. Among its dignitaries in this area, Dau su Le Van Lich and Giao huu Nguyen Huu Chinh were punished disciplinarily for having abused Co but and plotted to establish their own sect. In 1930, after being expelled from Tay Ninh Caodaism, Nguyen Huu Chinh left for My Tho. With the support from Le Van Lich and Minh Su\u2019s Co but groups, he founded a new sect of Caodaism called Tien Thien Great Religion for the Third Period of Universal Salvation (Tien Thien Dai dao Tam ky Pho do), also known as Tien Thien Caodaism.\n\nChon Ly Caodaism\nChon Ly Caodaism is also known as Minh Chon Ly Caodaism. It was the first sect to split from Tay Ninh Caodaism. Nguyen Van Ca, the founder of Chon Ly Caodaism, used to be a Phoi su of Tay Ninh Caodaism. In 1930, Nguyen Van Ca, who was described as serious and honest, expressed discontent with the way some of the high-ranking dignitaries managed Tay Ninh Caodaism. As a result, he left Tay Ninh for My Tho with the aim of practicing the faith and exposing the truth of Tay Ninh Caodaism. At first, he did not plan to cause dissension.\n\nMinh Chon Caodaism\nMinh Chon Caodaism originated from Chon Ly Caodaism. During 1931-1932, Cao Dai Chon Ly led by Nguyen Van Ca developed strongly and drew many high-ranking dignitaries from Tay Ninh Caodaism, including Chuong phap (Legislative Cardinal) Tran Dao Quang. However, after finding differences in the religion-practicing content of Chon Ly Caodaism, dignitaries Tran Dao Quang and Phan Van Thieu left for Bac Lieu. Here, they together with Cao Trieu Phat, Huynh Ngoc Ton and Nguyen Hien Ngo practiced the religion independently. In 1934, they declared the official establishment of a new Caodaist sect called Hau Giang Minh Chon Caodaism or Minh Chon Caodaism.\n\nCaodaist Missionary Holy Society\nEarly after its birth, Tay Ninh Caodaism conducted its missionary activities in the Central region of Vietnam. However, these activities were not successful as the Nguyen Dynasty had put a ban on the growth of Caodaism. In the late 1930s, despite the Nguyen Dynasty\u2019s prohibition, Cao Dai Tien Thien established 9 temples with nearly 10,000 followers. In late 1938, the Acting Caodaist Holy Society of Central Vietnam (Quyen Hoi thanh Trung Ky) was founded in Da Nang.\nAfter the August Revolution in 1945, the Acting Caodaist Holy Society of Central Vietnam cooperated with Ban Chinh Dao Caodaism in the North to establish the Agency for Caodaist\n\nBach Y Caodaism was separated from Chon Ly Caodaism in 1935 when its leaders had found differences in the religious practice of this Caodaist sect that were against Phap Chanh truyen and Tan luat.\n\nCau Kho Caodaism and cau Kho Tam Quan Caodaism\nWhen Caodaism fell into internal division, most of its dignitaries who disagreed with the leaders of Tay Ninh Caodaism went to the Cau Kho Temple for shelter and renamed it.\n\nChieu Minh Caodaism and Chieu Minh Long Chau Caodaism\nChieu Minh Caodaism was a Caodaist sect founded by Nguyen Minh Chieu, even before the official inauguration of Caodaism. Indeed, after splitting himself from Caodaism due to his concern over its political motivation, Nguyen Minh Chieu chose a site for religious practice in Hung Loi. Later, he developed it into a Caodaist temple and established a Caodaist sect named Chieu Minh Caodaism.\n\nMovements for Unity\nShortly after its establishment, Caodaism was plunged into internal division. This situation was immediately followed by movements for the unity of Caodaism.\nThe earliest movement broke out in 1936 and was initated by Tran Van Que from Cao Dai Tien Thien and some other dignitaries from the Cau Kho Temple (Sai Gon). This resulted in the establishment of an organization named the Caodaist Union of Great Religion.\n",
